# HTML Templates Guide

This guide will provide you with an overview of HTML templates and commonly used tags, including semantic tags and other useful tags.

## Semantic Tags

Semantic tags are used to describe the structure and content of a page in a more meaningful way. Here are some commonly used semantic tags:

- `<header>`: Used to represent the header of the page or a section.
- `<nav>`: Used to represent a navigation section.
- `<main>`: Used to represent the main content of the page.
- `<section>`: Used to represent a standalone section of a page.
- `<article>`: Used to represent standalone and reusable content, such as a blog post.
- `<aside>`: Used to represent related but non-essential content, such as advertisements.
- `<footer>`: Used to represent the footer of the page or a section.

These semantic tags help search engines and screen readers understand the structure and meaning of your content.

## Other Commonly Used Tags

In addition to semantic tags, there are many other useful tags for building HTML pages. Here are some examples:

- `<div>`: Used to group elements and apply CSS styles.
- `<span>`: Used to apply styles to a specific part of text within an element.
- `<img>`: Used to insert an image into the page.
- `<a>`: Used to create hyperlinks to other pages or resources.
- `<ul>` and `<li>`: Used to create unordered lists.
- `<ol>` and `<li>`: Used to create ordered lists.

These tags allow you to structure your content and add interactive elements to your pages.
